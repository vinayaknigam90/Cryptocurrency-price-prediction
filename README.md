# Cryptocurrency-price-prediction

The Project aims to perform data analysis on time-series data set for six cryptocurrencies Bitcoin, Ethereum, Ripple, Iota, Litecoin & Monero.The scope of this project: 

●  To predict and analyze historical prices for six cryptocurrencies using various machine learning models 
   and deduce the best fitted model.
●  Prediction of the prices of these cryptocurrencies 
●  Drawing a correlation among price fluctuations for these currencies
●  Periodic and Non-periodic trends in the price fluctuations

Algorithms used:
● SVR (Support Vector Regressor)
● LSTM (Long-Short Term Memory Recurrent Neural Network)
● Facebook Prophet
● ARIMA (AutoRegressive Integrated Moving Average)
